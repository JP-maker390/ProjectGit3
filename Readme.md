Readme_Question 3.  

Comments 

The issue was resolved based on the following steps: 

First, it was defined what a multiple of another number is. 
For example: a number is a multiple of 3 if its division by 3 is equal to zero. 

It was defined that the evolution step of the algorithm would be given by a counter 
together with the “while” function. The stopping point of the algorithm is the maximum 
value of "100" defined in the question requirement. 

The verification of the type of expression, numeric or character, is carried out as 
requested in the question, considering multiples of 3, 5 or (3 and 5).
